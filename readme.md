# Helping Hand: A Python Hand Gesture Recognition System 

This project focuses on recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet gestures using machine learning and computer vision techniques. This project was originally developed in 2024 as part of our Introduction to Data Science course, but was only published to GitHub in 2025. The repository serves as a backup and reference for future use.


## Features
- Real-time ASL gesture recognition.
- Easy-to-use interface for testing, capturing data, and training models.

## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.11
- Git

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd asl_recognition
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    py -m venv venv
    venv\scripts\activate   # For Windows
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the scripts in this order:
    ```bash
    collect_imgs.py
    create_dataset.py
    train_classifier.py
    inference_classifier.py
    ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to start recognizing ASL gestures.
